# WordPress Tutorial Theme: petj-mvp

## A **WordPress in the Classroom** theme

>This theme is one of the three themes I made for my book [WordPress in the Classroom](http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/ErhvervsakademiAarhus/Forskningsrapportguides/wordpress-in-the-classroom/). The themes are not made for production. They are made for the classroom, that is for students, developers and teachers learning the [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) craft and code. 

## Introduction to WordPress themes. 

A minimum viable WordPress theme. The
theme was developed for teaching themes.

The theme is a "minimal viable production".
The ambition is to have as litte markup and 
functionality as possible. The features are 

* Widgets
* Menu
* Title and content for pages and posts

The code is commented, often with a url to
online sources of inspiration.

Functions.php implements features, such as
costum background, and HTML5 forms. Here the
theme tries follow the recommendations for
theme developers.

Petj-mvp could be a starting point if you 
want to design a WordPress theme more or less
from scratch.
